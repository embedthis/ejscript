            Listen for client connections. This creates a HTTP server listening on a single socket endpoint. It can
            also be used to attach to an existing listening connection if embedded in a web server. 
            
            When hosted inside a web server, the web server will define the listening endpoints and ensure the 
            EjsScript startup script is executed. Then, when listen() is called, the HttpServer object will be bound to
            the actual web server's listening connection. In this case, the endpoint argument is not required and 
            is ignored.

            HttpServer supports both sync and async modes of operation.  In sync mode, after listen call is made, 
            $accept must be called to wait for and receive client connections. The $accept call will create the 
            Request object.  In async mode, Request objects will be created automatically and passed to registered 
            observers via "readable" events.

            @param endpoint The endpoint address on which to listen. An endoint may be a port number or a composite 
            "IP:PORT" string. If only a port number is provided, the socket will listen on all interfaces on that port. 
            The IP portion may also be "*" to indicate all interfaces.
            If the server is hosted in a web server, an appropriate existing web server listening connection will be 
            used. Otherwise, if not hosted, a server socket will be opened on the endpoint.
            If hosted and an endpoint is not provided, the server will listen on all appropriate web server connections.
            @throws ArgError if the specified endpoint address is not valid or available for binding.
