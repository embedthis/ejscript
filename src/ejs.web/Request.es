            Create a URI link. The target parameter may contain partial or complete URI information. The missing parts 
            are supplied using the current request and route tables. The resulting URI is a normalized, server-local 
            URI (begins with "/"). The URI will include any defined scriptName, but will not include scheme, host or 
            port components.

            @param target The URI target. The target parameter can be a URI string or object hash of components. If the 
                target is a string, it is may contain an absolute or relative URI. If the target has an absolute URI path, 
                that path is used unmodified. If the target is a relative URI, it is appended to the current request URI 
                path.  The target can also be an object hash of URI components: scheme, host, port, path, reference and
                query. If these component properties are supplied, these will be combined to create a URI.

                The URI will be created according to the route URI template. The template may be explicitly specified
                via a "route" target property. Otherwise, if an "action" property is specified, the route of the same
                name will be used. If these don't result in a usable route, the "default" route will be used. See the
                Router for more details.
               
                If the target is a string that begins with "\@" it will be interpreted as a controller/action pair of the 
                form "\@Controller/action". If the "controller/" portion is absent, the current controller is used. If 
                the action component is missing, the "index" action is used. A bare "\@" refers to the "index" action 
                of the current controller.

                Lastly, the target object hash may contain an override "uri" property. If specified, the value of the 
                "uri" property will be returned and all other properties will be ignored.

            @option scheme String URI scheme portion
            @option host String URI host portion
            @option port Number URI port number
            @option path String URI path portion
            @option reference String URI path reference. Does not include "#"
            @option query String URI query parameters. Does not include "?"
            @option controller String Controller name if using a Controller-based route. This can also be specified via
                the action option.
            @option action String Action to invoke. This can be a URI string or a Controller action of the form
                @Controller/action.
            @option route String Route name to use for the URI template
            @return A normalized, server-local Uri object. The returned URI will be an absolute URI.

                The rxHeaders property specifies that the headers (including first line) of the request should be traced.
                The rxBody property specifies that the body content of the request should be traced.
