            Run a command using the system command shell and wait for completion. On Windows, this requires that
            sh.exe is installed (See Cygwin). 
            @param command The (optional) command line to initialize with. The command may be either a string or
                an array of arguments. 
            @param options Command options hash. Supported options are:
            @options detach Boolean If true, run the command and return immediately. If detached, finalize() must be
                called to signify the end of data being written to the command's stdin. In this case, sh returns null.
            @options dir Path or String. Directory to set as the current working directory for the command.
            @options exceptions Boolean If true, throw exceptions if the command returns a non-zero status code. 
                Defaults to true.
            @options timeout Number This is the default number of milliseconds for the command to complete.
            @options stream Stream the stdout from the command to the current standard output. Defaults to false.
            @param data Optional data to write to the command on it's standard input.
            @return The command output from the standard output.
            @throws IOError if the command exits with non-zero status. The exception object will contain the command's
                standard error output.

                quotes will be stripped and the backquote will be passed in. Windows crt runtime handles this correctly.
                For example:  ./args "c:/path \"a b\"
                    Cygwin will parse as  argv[1] == c:/path \a \b
                    Windows will parse as argv[1] == c:/path "a b"
