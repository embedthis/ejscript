/*
    Cache.es -- Cache class providing key/value storage.

    Usage Tutorial:

        cache = new Cache("local", {lifespan: 86400, timeout: 5000, memory: 200000000, keys: 10000000})

        session = cache.read(key)
        cache.write(key, value, {lifespan: 3600})
        cache.remove(key)
        cache.destroy()

        cache = new Cache("memcached", {addresses: ["127.0.0.1:11211"], debug: false})
        cache = new Cache("file", {dir: "/tmp"})

        Ejs internally uses the key naming convention:  ::module::key
