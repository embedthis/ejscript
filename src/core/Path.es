            Get a list of matching files. This does Posix style glob file matching on supplied patterns and returns an
            array of matching files.

            This method supports several invocation forms:
            <ul>
                <li>files(pattern, {options})</li>
                <li>files([pattern, pattern, ...], {options})</li>

                <li>files([{files: pattern, options...}])</li>
            </ul>

            A single pattern may be supplied with or with out options. Multiple patterns may be provided in an array.
            Alternatively, the pattern or patterns may be provided via an object with a 'files' property. In this case, the
            options are provided in the same object. If the pattern is omitted, the default is to search for all files
            under the Path by using '**' as the pattern.

            @param patterns Pattern to match files. This can be a String, Path or array of String/Paths.
            If the Path is a directory, then files that match the specified patterns are returned.
            If the Path is not a directory, then the path itself is matched against the pattern.
            The following special sequences are supported:
            <ul>
                <li>The wildcard '?' matches any single character</li>
                <li>* matches zero or more characters in a filename or directory</li>
                <li>** matches zero or more files or directories and matches recursively in a directory tree</li>
                <li>! Negates pattern. This removes matching patterns from the set. These are applied after all source
                      patterns have been processed. Use !! to escape or set noneg in options.
            </ul>
            If a pattern ends with '/', then the directory contents will also match and be returned.

            @param options Optional properties to control the matching.
            @option contents Boolean If contents is set to true and the path pattern matches a directory, then return the
                contents of the directory in addition to the directory itself. This applies if the pattern matches an
                existing directory or the pattern ends with '/'. This is implemented by appending '**' to the pattern.

            @option depthFirst Boolean Do a depth first traversal of directories. If true, then the directories will be
                shown after the files in the directory. Otherwise, directories will be listed first. Defaults to false.

            @option directories Boolean Include directories in the results. Defaults to true.

            @option exclude String | Regular | Function Blacklist of files to exclude from the results.
                Matches the full source path including the Path value. Only for the purpose of this match,
                directories will have '/' appended.

                If 'exclude' is a function, the file is not processed if the function returns true. The function callback
                has the form:

                Function(filename: Path, options: Object): Boolean

                The file argument is the filename being considered, it include the Path value.
                The value of "this" is set to the Path value.

                By default, exclude is set to exclude hidden files starting with '.' and files that look like temporary
                files.

            @option expand Object | Function Expand tokens in filenames using this object or function. If 'expand'
                is an object, then expand filename tokens of the form '${token}' using the object key values.
                If 'expand' is a function, it should have the signature:

                Function(filename: String, options: Object): String

            @option hidden Boolean Include hidden files starting with '.' Defaults to false.

            @option include String | RegExp | Function Whitelist of files to include in the results.
                Matches the full source path including the Path value. Only for the purpose of this match,
                directories will have '/' appended.

                If 'include' is a function, the file is processed if the function returns true. The function callback
                has the form:

                Function(filename: Path, options: Object): Boolean

                The file argument is the filename being considered, it include the Path value.
                The value of "this" is set to the Path value.

            @option missing String Determine what happens if a pattern does not match any files.
                Set to undefined to report patterns that don't resolve by throwing an exception.
                Set to null to do nothing and omit the pattern from the results.
                Set to the empty string to use the pattern itself in the results.
                Set to other value to be used in the results in place of the pattern when there are no matching
                    files or directories.
                Default is null.

            @option noneg Boolean Do not process negated file patterns.

            @option relative Boolean | String | Path Return filesnames relative to the path provided by the 'relative'
                option, otherwise results include the Path value. If set to true, the results will be relative to the
                current directory. Defaults to false.

            @return An Array of Path objects for each file in the directory.
                The returned file list includes the Path itself. If the 'relative' option is provided, a path

                <li>operate([{from: pattern, to: directory, options...}])</li>
            </ul>
            The 'options' may supply a desired 'operation' property that may be set to 'copy', 'move', 'append' or custom
            action. This defaults to 'copy'.

            The 'from' patterns are resolved using the #Path.files method to create an input files list.
            All the options for Path.files are supported.

            Operate will resolve the input patterns relative to the Path itself. If copying, that directory portion relative
            to the Path will be appended to the destination 'to' argument. In this manner, entire directory trees can be
            easily copied.

            @return The number of files processed. If the operation is 'list', returns the expanded source file list.

            @param from Path | String | Object | Array This may be a String or Path containing the source paths to
                process. Alternatively, it may be an object that supplies 'from', 'to' and 'options' as processing
                instructions. It may also be an array of Paths, Strings or Objects. The 'from' patterns may contain:
                    *
                    **
                    ?
                    !   Negates pattern. This removes matching patterns from the set. These are applied after all source
                        patterns have been processed. Use !! to escape.
                If item is a directory or ends with '/', then "**" is automatically appended to match the directory
                contents.

            @param to String | Path Destination target. If 'from' is a Path or String, then the 'to' argument
                must be a destination Path or String. If 'from' is an Object or Array of instruction objects that contains
                a 'to' property, then 'to' should be omitted and will be ignored. If multiple source files are specified
                or the destination ends in the separator '/', the destination is assumed to be a directory. If the
                destination is a directory, the destination filename is created by appending the the source path to the
                directory.

            @param control Additional processing instructions. All the options provided by #Path.files are
                also supported.

            @option active Boolean If destination is an active executable or library, rename the active file using a '.old'
                extension and retry.

            @option compress Boolean Compress destination file using Zlib. Results in a '.gz' extension.

            @option divider String Divider text to use before each appended file.

            @option dividerFile String|Path File containing divider text to after each appended file.

            @option extension String | Path Extension to use for the destination filenames.

            @option extensionDot String Specifies where the filename extension begins for filenames with multiple dots.
                Set to 'first' or 'last'.

            @option filter RegExp Pattern of lines to filter out from appended files.

            @option flatten Boolean Flatten the input source tree to a single level. Defaults to true.

            @option footer String Footer to append when appending files.

            @option group String | Number System group name or number to use for the destination files.

            @option header String Header prepend when appending files.

            @option isDir Assume the destination is a directory. Create if it does not exist. Same as appending a
                trailing '/' to the 'to' argument.

            @option keep Boolean Keep uncompressed file after compressing.

            @option operation String Set to 'append' to append files, 'copy' to copy files and 'move' to move files.
                Set to 'list' to return a file list in options.list and perform no operations. Defaults to 'copy' if unset.

            @option patch Object. Expand file contents tokens using this object. Object hash containing properties to use
                when replacing tokens of the form ${token} in file contents.

            @option perform Function Callback function to perform the operation on a matching file.
                This function should return true if it handles the file and default processing is not required.
                Note that post processing still occurs including compression and stripping if required regardless of the
                return value.

                Function(from: Path, to: Path, options: Object): Boolean

            @option permissions Number Posix style permissions mask. E.g. 0644.

                'relative' option, otherwise destination filenames include the Path value. If set to true, the destination
                 will be relative to the current directory. If set, implies flatten == false. Defaults to false.

                a link is created in the directory specified by 'symlink' using the source file basename as the link name.

            @option trim Number of path components to trim from the start of the source filename.
                If set, implies flatten == false.

            @option user String | Number System user account name or number to use for destination files.
