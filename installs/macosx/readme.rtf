Removing Ejscript\
\
This is the procedure to remove Ejscript on all systems except Windows.\
\
   1. Change directory to the installation directory for Ejscript. This is usually /usr/local/lib/ejs/latest.\
\
   2. Run the uninstall script in the install directory for Ejscript by typing \
\
      sudo ./uninstall\
\
\
\
Windows Release Details\
\
To install the Windows Installer image:\
\
   1. Login with administrator privileges. This is necessary as the binary \
      installation needs to install a Windows Service.\
\
   2. Use WinZip or equivalent software to extract the installation image. This\
      will extract the README.TXT and setup.exe from the zip archive.\
\
   3. Double click on the setup.exe image to run it.\
\
\
Removing Ejscript on Windows\
\
If you installed the Ejscript Windows Installer image, follow these steps to \
remove Ejscript. If you installed the Tar self-install image, you will need \
to remove Ejscript manually. \
\
   1. Login with administrator privileges\
\
   2. Run the Add / Remove Programs applet from the control panel.\
\
   3. Select the Embedthis Ejscript and choose remove.\
\
\
Running Ejscript\
\
The Ejscript product installation includes a simple command line interpreter that can be invoked by typing:\
\
    ejs\
\
This command responds with the following prompt:\
\
ejs>\
\
Ejscript commands can be entered and results will be echoed to the console.  See the user documentation for further details.\
\
Running Ejscript on Windows\
\
On windows, the installation creates a Programs shortcut for the "ejs" Ejscript command shell.  Clicking on it will run "ejs" in a command window.  To run "ejs" from a command window manually, you may need to add the Ejscript installation bin directory to your path. This is usually the C:/Program Files/Embedthis Ejscript/bin directory. You can do this by running the System applet from the Control Panel and selecting the Advanced tab and then the Environment Variables button at the bottom of the page. Add this directory to the setting for the PATH use variable.\
\
\
