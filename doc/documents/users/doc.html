            <h1>Generating Documentation</h1>
            <p>To make usable class libraries to share with others, effective class library documentation is essential.
            For Ejscript programs, the <strong><a href="ejsmod.html">ejsmod</a></strong> program can generate HTML
            documentation for class libraries similar to the Java, Javadoc tools. The ejsmod tool extracts the
            documentation from comments in the script code and from the script variable, function and type
            declarations. It automatically documents all non-private elements and creates a complete HTML web site for
            the documentation.</p>
            <p>The <a href="../../../api/ejscript/index.html">Ejscript Language Library</a> documentation has been
            prepared using the ejsmod tool.</p>
            <h2>Preparing Your Source</h2>
            <p>The first step in generating documentation is to add comments to your source code. These comments are
            called <strong>ejsdoc</strong> comments and are valid Ejscript comments that begin with the characters
            <strong>/**</strong>. For example:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
/**
 *  Users full name including first and last name.
 */
var userName
</pre>
            <p>By default, <b>ejsmod</b> will generate documentation for all elements regardless of whether they have
            an ejsdoc comment, but the description for elements without an ejsdoc comment will be empty.</p>
            <h2>Ejsdoc Comments</h2>
            <p>Ejsdoc comments will be parsed by ejsmod to extract information for the commented element, starting with
            the first sentence.</p>
            <h3>First Sentence</h3>
            <p>The first sentence is special. It is the brief, one line description used in indices and overviews. You
            don't need any special "@brief" or other tag like other documentation tools. Ejsmod uses a set of
            conventions to make documenting your code easier and the first of these conventions is to extract the first
            sentence as a brief description.</p>
            <h3>Remaining Sentences</h3>
            <p>The remaining sentences in the ejsdoc comment are captured as the full description for the element. The
            first sentence is removed and stored as the brief description, but will be restored in some locations where
            relevant to the documentation.</p>
            <h3>AT Directives</h3>
            <p>Embedded in the ejsdoc comment may be a set of directives that begin with the <strong>@</strong>
            character. These typically are either one liners or continue until the next @directive or the end of the
            ejsdoc comment.</p>
            <table title="directives">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Directive</th>
                        <th>Format</th>
                        <th>Description</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>@param</td>
                    <td class="nowrap">@param name Description</td>
                    <td>Describe a parameter. The description continues up to the next @directive or the end of the
                    ejsdoc comment. Multiple @param directives are permitted.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>@return</td>
                    <td>@return Description</td>
                    <td>Describe the return value. If the sentence starts with a lower case word, then ejsmod will
                    append the word "Returns" to the start of the description. You can also use (or misuse) the
                    directive as @returns. Only a single @return directive is permitted.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>@throw</td>
                    <td class="nowrap">@throw TypeError Description</td>
                    <td>Describe an exception that may be thrown by the function. The TypeError should be the name of
                    an Error class. The description continues up to the next @directive or the end of the ejsdoc
                    comment. Multiple @param directives are permitted.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>@example</td>
                    <td>@example Multi-line example</td>
                    <td>Describe an example that illustrates use of the API. The description continues up to the next
                    @directive or the end of the ejsdoc comment. Multiple @example directives are permitted.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>@spec</td>
                    <td>@spec name, [, name ...]</td>
                    <td>Describe the standards conformance of the element. Typical values include ejs-NN for Ejscript
                    conformant or ecma-3 for ECMAScript 3 compliance.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>@see</td>
                    <td>@see name [, name ...]</td>
                    <td>Create a "See Also" link to another element in the documentation. Names should be comma
                    separated. Multiple @see directives are permitted.</td>
                </tr>
                </tbody>

            <p>Here is an example comment specification from the Ejscript Language Library</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
/**
 *  Search for an item using strict equality "===". This call 
 *  searches from the start of the array for the specified element.

 *         searching for the object.
 *  @return The items index into the array if found, otherwise -1.

 *          than or equal to the size of the array or less then 0.

function indexOf(element: Object, 
    startIndex: Number = 0): Number
{
}

            <h3>Embedded HTML</h3>
            <p>The ejsdoc comment may contain embedded HTML which will be passed through to the documentation without
            modification. In this manner, you can add your own styling. For example:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
/** Some &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; text */
</pre>
            <h3>Styling</h3>
            <p>Ejsmod generates a style sheet for use with the documentation. You are welcome to modify the contents of
            this style sheet, but it will be generated each time. Ejsmod is not yet capable of being "skinned" or
            "styled" to suite individual needs. This is planned for a future release.</p>
