            <h1>Using the Command Shell</h1>
            <p>The <strong>ejs</strong> command is a command shell for the Ejscript language and can be used to
            interactively interpret commands typed at the console or to run script files.</p>
            <h2>Interactive Mode</h2>
            <p>When invoked with no files on the command line (and without --class or --method switches), ejs runs in
            interactive mode. In this mode, ejs reads input from the console and parses and executes scripts as they
            are typed to the console.</p>
            <p>In interactive mode, ejs will read input until it has a complete block of code and then will execute the
            block. The last result value computed will be echoed to the console. For example:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
<b>ejs</b>
<b>ejs-0&gt;</b>  if (true) { 
<b>ejs-2&gt;</b>     print("Hello World"); 
<b>ejs-2&gt;</b> }
<b><strong>Hello World</strong></b>
<b>ejs-0&gt;</b>
</pre>
            <p>Note: the input prompt includes a level of nest indicator starting at zero and increasing upward as
            commands nest. This is a hint as to when you have closed sufficient braces for <b>ejs</b> to execute your
            command. As this is an internal compiler nest value, it will sometimes increment more than one for each
            brace.</p>
            <h2>Executing Script Files</h2>
            <p>If ejs is invoked with a file name on the command line, that file will be read and its statements
            executed. One file may be supplied and the arguments after it will be passed into the script as command
            line arguments. For example:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
<strong>ejs</strong> myscript.es arg1 arg2 arg3
</pre>
            <p>If myscript.es contained the following script:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
print(App.args)
</pre>
            <p>the following would be output:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
<strong><b>myscript.es,arg1,arg2,arg3</b></strong>
</pre>
            <p>The script file may be either a script file or an Ejscript module with a ".mod" extension that has been
            previously compiled with the <a href="compiler.html"><strong>ejsc</strong></a> command.</p>
            <p>If you require more script files to be parsed, use the --files "files ..." switch to supply extra
            scripts. These will be parsed in order, but after the primary script on the command line. For example:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
<strong>ejs</strong> --files "extraScript1.es extraScript2.es" myscript.es arg1 arg2 arg3
</pre>
            <p>In most cases, this is not necessary as you can use the "require" directive in your program cause a
            module to be loaded as required.</p>
            <h3>Run a Designated Method</h3>
            <p>The ejs command can also invoke a specific static method on startup. If either the --class or --method
            switches are supplied, then ejs will run the requested static method after the input file script statements
            have been executed. If the --method switch is omitted, then the "main" method name is used. If the --class
            switch is omitted, the first class with a static main method is used. For example:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
ejs --class MyClass --method "main" myscript.es
</pre>
            <p>This command will load the myscript.es file, run the script and then invoke the static
            <strong>main</strong> method in the MyClass class.</p>
            <h2>Command Options</h2>
            <p>The ejs command may be invoked with the following command options:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
ejs [--class className] [--cmd "literal script"] [--debug] 
    [--debugger] [--files "files..."] [--log logSpec] 
    [--method methodName] [--nodebug] [--optimize level] 
    [--require "modules"] [--searchPath ejsPath] [--standard]
    [--stats] [--strict] [--verbose] [--version] [--warn level] 
    <b>file [arguments ...]</b>
</pre>The ejs command will parse and execute the given <strong>file</strong> with the supplied arguments passed into
the App.args property.

                        command will use when locating and loading Ejscript modules. Given a module named "a.b.c" in a
                        script, ejs will use the following search strategy to locate the module:</p>
                        <p>1. Search for a module file named "a.b.c.mod"</p>
                        <p>2. Search for a module file named "a/b/c.mod"</p>
                        <p>3. Search for a module file named "a.b.c.mod" in EJSPATH</p>

                        <p>The search path is initially specified via the environment variable EJSPATH and may be
                        overridden via the --searchPath ejsPath switch. EJSPATH and the ejsPath command line value are
                        similar to the system PATH formats. On windows, path segments are separated by ";" and on
                        Linux, Unix, FreeBSD and MAC, the path segments are separated by ":" delimiters.</p>
