See below for operating system specific installation information.


Development Environment Platform Support

If you wish to embed Ejscript in your application or build Ejscript from source code, you will need to use a C compiler and associated development tools.  Several development environments are supported.  You may choose any of the following:

    * Linux/Unix GNU Tools

    * Windows Visual Studio 2010 or later

    * WindRiver Tornado Development Tools


Apple Mac OS X Release Details

To install the native MAC OS X PKG image:

   1. Download the PKG image.

   2. Double click on the PKG file image.
 
   3. Answer the questions as prompted.


Windows Release Details

To install the Windows Installer image:

   1. Login with administrator privileges. This is necessary as the binary 
      installation needs to install a Windows Service.

   2. Use WinZip or equivalent software to extract the installation image. This
      will extract the README.TXT and setup.exe from the zip archive.

   3. Double click on the setup.exe image to run it.


Removing Ejscript on MAC OS X

This is the procedure to remove Ejscript on all systems except Windows.

   1. Change directory to the installation directory for Ejscript. This is usually /usr/lib/ejscript.

   2. Run the uninstall script in the install directory for Ejscript by typing 

      sudo ./uninstall


Removing Ejscript on Windows

If you installed the Ejscript Windows Installer image, follow these steps to 
remove Ejscript. If you installed the Tar self-install image, you will need 
to remove Ejscript manually. 

   1. Login with administrator privileges

   2. Run the Add / Remove Programs applet from the control panel.

   3. Select the Embedthis Ejscript and choose remove.


Running Ejscript

The Ejscript product installation includes a simple command line interpreter that can be invoked by typing:

    ejs

This command responds with the following prompt:

ejs>

Ejscript commands can be entered and results will be echoed to the console.  See the user documentation for further details.

Running Ejscript on Windows

On windows, the installation creates a Programs shortcut for the "ejs" Ejscript command shell.  Clicking on it will run "ejs" in a command window.  To run "ejs" from a command window manually, you may need to add the Ejscript installation bin directory to your path. This is usually the C:/Program Files/Embedthis Ejscript/bin directory. You can do this by running the System applet from the Control Panel and selecting the Advanced tab and then the Environment Variables button at the bottom of the page. Add this directory to the setting for the PATH use variable.


Building from the Source Code

If you wish to rebuild the Ejscript product from the distributed source code, please download the source code distribution from the Embedthis web site. Then read "Building from Source" in the Ejscript product documentation for an explanation of the necessary steps to successfully rebuild the product.
