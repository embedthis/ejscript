            <h1>Language Modes</h1>
            <p>Ejscript is fully compliant with the JavaScript (<a href=
            "http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm">ECMA-262 3.X</a>) standards, but it
            also offers a set of enhancements and fixes designed to improve the language and correct some longstanding
            JavaScript design issues. Use of these enhancements and fixes is optional and controlled via <i>opt-in</i>
            configuration and script pragma directives. Language modes can be selected on a source file-by-file basis.
            So you can mix and match ECMA-262 pure JavaScript with enhanced Ejscript code if you wish.</p>

            <h2 >Compiler Checking Mode</h2>
            <p>The Compiler checking mode controls how aggressively the compiler warns about potential program
            errors.</p>
            <p>Ejscript supports two checking modes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>standard</b> &mdash; Traditional JavaScript compilation with little compile time checking</li>
                <li><b>strict</b> &mdash; Uses strict static type checking at compile time</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Strict mode is useful for libraries where detecting errors before run-time is highly desirable. Strict
            mode also assists the compiler to generate faster code as the compiler knows the location and type of all
            variables ahead of time. However, it does restrict your coding style by requiring that all variables be
            declared and typed &mdash; this should be used on a case-by-case basis.</p>
            <p>For users of a module, it does not matter whether the module was created using strict or standard
            checking. The checking mode only impacts the module source code itself and not the users of the module.</p>
            <p>The compiler checking mode can be controlled by a <b>use standard</b> or <b>use strict</b> pragma
            directive in your scripts. Like the Language Compliance pragma, this pragma takes effect on a file by file
            basis.</p><a id="standard"></a>
            <h2>Standard Mode</h2>
            <p>Standard mode is the traditional JavaScript compilation behavior. Variables do not have to be declared
            ahead of time and no warnings are issued for incompatible type usage. Issues are resolved at run-time, by
            dynamic casting or by issuing exceptions.</p><a id="strict"></a>
            <h2>Strict Mode</h2>
            <p>Strict mode applies compile time static checking and type conversions to try to handle and catch errors
            before run-time. In strict mode, variables must be declared before they are used. If the script code is not
            using <b>ecma</b> language compliance, variables must also be typed. Functions must define a return type
            and must type their parameters.</p>
            
            <a id="setCompiler"></a>
            <h2 >Setting the Compiler Checking Mode</h2>
            <p>The compiler mode control is set to a default value by command line switches to the <b>ejs</b> shell or
            <b>ec</b> compiler. This can be overridden by an Ejscript pragma directive in your script files on a
            file-by-file basis.</p>
            <h2>Command Line Compiler Checking Switch</h2>
            <p>To set the compiler checking mode on the <b>ejs</b> or <b>ec</b> commands, use the <b>--strict</b> or
            <b>--standard</b> switch. The default is --standard.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
ejs --standard script1.es
ejs --strict script2.es
</pre>
            <h2>Use Strict and Use Standard Pragmas</h2>
            <p>To set the compiler checking mode for a source file, utilize the <b>use strict</b> or <b>use
            standard</b> pragma directives. These pragmas will override the default value for the current source
            file.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
/* In source file 1 */
use strict
/* In source file 2 */
use standard
/* In source file 3 */
/* No use pragma - just accept the current default */
</pre>
