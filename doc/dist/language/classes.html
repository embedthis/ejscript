            <h1>Classes and Object Instances</h1>
            <p>JavaScript is an object-oriented language that uses a prototype-based mechanism for creating classes and
            object instances. This is somewhat unusual and does take some getting used to. It creates classes by means
            of constructor functions to create and configure for object instances. After years of experimenting,
            certain best practices have evolved to support creating classes, instances, overriding methods and
            controlling member visibility.</p>
            <p>Ejscript enhances standard JavaScript by providing classical <b>class</b> and <b>interface</b>
            directives to simplify the creation of classes and instance objects. This mechanism is compatible with the
            standard prototype based inheritance. It is your choice which mechanism you choose to use, you can even mix
            and match techniques. If you prefer traditional <a href="#prototype">prototype-based</a> inheritance, then
            use that. If you prefer the simpler, more classical <a href="#class">class-based</a> inheritance, go for
            it.</p><a id="prototype"></a>
            <h2 >Prototype Inheritance</h2>
            <p>Prototype Inheritance uses constructor functions to create and initialize instances. The object instance
            is created via the <b>new</b> operator. Given a constructor called <b>Rectangle</b>, the following
            statement will create a new Rectangle instance.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
var rect = new Rectangle(10, 20)
</pre>
            <p>When the <b>new</b> statement is executed, it creates a new bare object and passes that object to the
            Rectangle constructor as the <b>this</b> object.</p>The Rectangle constructor's job is to configure the
            object instance.
            <h3>Instance Properties</h3>
            <p>Instance properties are created by simple assignment in the constructor function.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
function Rectangle(width, height) {
    this.width = width
    this.height = height
}
</pre>
            <p>In this example, the <b>Rectangle</b> constructor function creates two new instance properties
            <i>height</i> and <i>width</i> by assigning initial values to them. Because the constructor function is run
            each time a new instance is created and <b>this</b> is bound to the new objects &mdash; this will
            effectively create and initialize instance properties.</p>
            <p>Behind the scenes, Ejscript optimizes object creating by using a technique called <i>Object Shaping</i>,
            where the VM creates and updates hidden classes to represent the object instances.</p>
            <h3>Methods</h3>
            <p>Although functions can be assigned to instance properties in the constructor function, there is a better
            way to create methods by using the constructor function's prototype object.</p>
            <p>Every function in JavaScript has a prototype object which is like a hidden class object for the
            constructor. The prototype object contains properties that will appear in every instance created by the
            constructor and is the ideal place to create methods and class constants that you want to share between all
            instances.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
Rectangle.prototype.area = function() {
    return this.width * this.height
}
</pre>
            <p>This creates a method called area that will be accessible from Rectangle instances. Note that when you
            add a function to the prototype it is added to all instances &mdash; even pre-existing instances.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
print(rect.area())
</pre>
            <p>Properties are not copied from the prototype object into instances. Rather, the property lookup
            mechanism will search the prototype object if a named property is not found in the instance itself. This
            significantly reduces the memory required to store objects when multiple instances of a class are being
            created.</p>
            <p>If a prototype property is updated by an instance, the VM will update the object instance which will
            then effectively shadow or replace the prototype property.</p>
            <h3>Class Methods</h3>
            <p>To create a class method, simply attach a function to the constructor function.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
Rectangle.makeSquare = function(length) {
    return new Rectangle(length, length)
}
</pre>
            <p>This creates a class factory method which creates squares.</p>
            <h3>Class Properties</h3>
            <p>To create class properties or constants that are shared across all instances, use the same technique as
            that used for methods: create the property via the constructor prototype object.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
Circle.prototype.PI = 3.1415926
</pre>
            <p>This creates a shared property in the Circle class for PI.</p>
            <h3>Visibility</h3>
            <p>JavaScript has techniques to create private properties that are visible only to the methods of the
            class. Declare a local variable inside the function constructor to create a private property.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
function Circle(radius) {
    <b>var area = 3.14 * radius * radius</b>
    this.radius = radius
}
</pre>
            <p>To access radius in other methods, requires defining the method inside the constructor as a closure.
            Closure functions capture their outer scope and thus have access to the private variables of the
            constructor.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
function Circle(radius) {
    var area = 3.14 * radius * radius
    this.radius = radius
    <b>this.getArea = function() { 
        return area
    }</b>
}
</pre>
            <h3>Inheritance</h3>
            <p>To implement inheritance into your classes, we exploit the prototype object again. The constructor's
            prototype object itself has a prototype which is by default Object.prototype. However, this can be modified
            to point to another class and thus create a prototype chain.</p>
            <p>When searching for a property, if the VM fails to find the property in the object instance, it will
            search the object's prototype property. If it is not found on the prototype, the VM searches the
            prototype's prototype, and so on, until Object.prototype is searched. This creates a lookup and inheritance
            chain.</p>
            <p>This next example will create a Square class by extending the Rectangle class we previously created.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
function Square(length) {
    /* Call the rectangle base class */
    <b>Rectangle.call(this, length, length)</b>
}
/* Set the base class for Square */
<b>Square.prototype = new Rectangle</b>
/* Reset the constructor for Square */
<b>Square.prototype.constructor = Square</b>
Square.prototype.isSquare = function() { return true; }
var square = new Square(10)
/* Invoke Rectangle.getArea() */
print(square.getArea())
</pre>
            <p>Yes I know this is not pretty, this is why we added <a href="#class">class-based</a> inheritance to
            Ejscript. It is much easier and more intuitive. There are also other <a href="#alternate">alternative
            approaches</a> &mdash; all with their strengths and weaknesses.</p><a id="alternate"></a>
            <h3>Alternate Approaches</h3>
            <p>There are many patterns for creating classes and doing inheritances. JavaScript is amazingly flexible.
            Here are a some links to alternative approaches.</p>

            </ul><a id="class"></a>
            <h2 >Class Inheritance</h2>
            <p>Because the standard JavaScript Prototypal Inheritance mechanism is a little tedious to work with,
            Ejscript adds a classical class based inheritance facility. It is syntactic sugar over the prototype
            inheritance, but also it has support in the VM to provide higher performance than that offered by pure
            Prototypal Inheritance.</p>
            <p>Class inheritance uses the <b>class</b> keyword to define classes.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
class Rectangle {
    var     height
    var     width
} 
</pre>
            <p>This creates a simple class object called Rectangle. This is loosely equivalent to the prototype object
            used in <a href="#prototype">Prototypal</a> Inheritance. Instances can now be created by using
            <b>new</b>.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
var rect = new Rectangle
</pre>
            <h3>Instance Properties</h3>
            <p>This creates a new Rectangle object and sets its hidden <b>prototype</b> object to point to the
            Rectangle class. It also automatically creates the instance properties: height and width. However, they are
            not yet initialized. We really need to provide a constructor function so we can define the height and width
            values of the rectangle.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
class Rectangle {
    var     height
    var     width
    <b>function Rectangle(h, w) {
        height = h
        width = w
    }</b>
}
</pre>
            <p>This time, when <b>new Rectangle</b> is invoked, the constructor will initialize height and width.
            Notice that Rectangle must be defined inside the class block and that it has access to the private height
            and width variables. If we want to make height and width visible to users outside the class, then we add a
            public qualifier to the declaration.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
public var height
</pre>
            <h3>Methods</h3>
            <p>To create methods, you add functions to the class block just as we did for the constructor. If you want
            the function to be visible outside, add a <b>public</b> qualifier.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
class Rectangle {
    /* Portions omitted */
    <b>public function area() {
        return height * width
    }</b>
    /* Private function */
    private function grow() {
    }
}
</pre>
            <h3>Class Methods</h3>
            <p>Class methods are created by using the <b>static</b> qualifier. Class (or static) methods do not have
            access to any instances. When they run, the <b>this</b> property is set to the class object itself.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
class Rectangle {
    <b>public static function makeSquare(length) {
        return new Rectangle(length, length)
    }</b>
}
</pre>
            <h3>Class Properties</h3>
            <p>Class properties that are shared across all instances are created similarly to class methods by using a
            <b>static</b> qualifier.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
class Rectangle {
    <b>public static var goldenRation = 1.618034</b>
}
</pre>
            <h3>Visibility</h3>
            <p>Controlling visibility is achieved by using the internal, public, private and protected qualifier
            keywords. Class members can be made visible throughout the source file in which they are declared by using
            the <b>internal</b> qualifier. This is the default visibility for a declaration if no qualifier is
            used.</p>
            <p>To make a declaration visible outside the source file, use <b>public</b> on your declarations.</p>
            <p>To make class members private and only visible inside the class, use the <b>private</b> qualifier. To
            permit sub-classes to access members, but deny access to code outside the class, use the <b>protected</b>
            qualifier.</p>
            <p>Visibility can also be controlled on a module basis by using Module directives. See the <a href=
            "modules.html">Modules and Namespaces</a> document for details.</p>
            <h3>Inheritance</h3>
            <p>To inherit or sub-class a class, use the <b>extends</b> keyword.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
class Square <b>extends Rectangle</b> {
    function Square(length) {
        <b>super(length, length)</b>
    }
}
</pre>
            <p>This example extends Rectangle to create a derived class Square. The Square constructor invokes the
            Rectangle constructor via the <b>super</b> pseudo-property.</p>
            <h3>Early Binding</h3>
            <p>The Ejscript compiler performs early-binding. This means it searches for properties and resolves whether
            they reside in the object instance, class or sub-classes. Once found, the compiler generates direct
            references to the property and avoids the run-time scanning of the prototype chain. This is typically
            dramatically faster than runtime property lookup.</p><a id="reflection"></a>
            <h2 >Reflection</h2>
            <p>Ejscript provides a set of operators and classes to enable you to determine the type of an object and
            reflect upon its members.</p>
            <p>The JavaScript standard <b>typeof</b> operator can be used to test the type of an object. It returns a
            string that describes the object type.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
print(typeof 5)
print(typeof "Hello World")
/* Emits */
<b>number</b>
<b>string</b>
</pre>
            <p>Unfortunately, the typeof operator has its quirks and doesn't behave as expected in some cases. It
            returns "boolean" for booleans, "function" for functions, "number" for numbers, "string" for strings and
            "undefined" for undefined values. So far so good. However, It returns "object" for objects, arrays, dates,
            regular expressions and null. Further, if you use a Number, String or Boolean wrapper object, it also
            evaluates to "object". This makes typeof much less useful. Ejscript provides a more predictable reflection
            capability that fixes these deficits.</p>
            <p>The <b>instanceof</b> operator tests whether an object is an instance of a class object (or function
            constructor).</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
rect = new Rectangle
print(rect instanceof Rectangle)
</pre>
            <h3>Reflect Class</h3>
            <p>The <b>Reflect</b> class is an Ejscript extension that provides more consistent and comprehensive class
            and object introspection facilities. It provides an out-of-band reflection capability and does not pollute
            the class and objects themselves with additional properties or methods.</p>
            <p>The Reflect class provides a function constructor that can be used without <b>new</b> to return a
            reflection object. This reflection object can then be used to examine the target object.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
var rect = new Rectangle(1, 10)
examine = Reflect(rect)
print(examine.typeName)
/* Emits */
<b>Shape</b>
</pre><a id="interface"></a>
            <h2 >Interfaces</h2>
            <p>Interfaces are used to create contracts for classes. They specify the required methods (or contract) the
            class must implement to validly support a given interface. These are very similar to ActionScript or Java
            interfaces.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
interface Shape {
    function render()
    function getArea()
}
</pre>
