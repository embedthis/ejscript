            <h1>Request Routing</h1>
            <a id="overview"></a>
            <p>Ejscript includes a powerful request routing engine that processes client HTTP requests. The engine
            is configured with a set of routes and when a request is received, it tests various routes and selects
            the best route to handle the request.  In the process, routes may redirect or rewrite the request 
            as required.</p>
            <img src="../images/routing.jpg" alt="routing"/>
            <p>An Ejscript application will typically have many routes. The configured routes 
            are tested in-order by matching the route pattern against the request URI. 
            A route may require that further preconditions be met before it is suitable to process the
            request. If the required conditions are not met, the next route in the configuration will be tested. There 
            is always a catch-all route that will process the request if all prior routes fail to qualify.</p>
            <p>A route may modify the request during processing by changing the request URI or request data. The
            route may also run commands as a side-effect during processing.</p>

            <a id="configuration"></a>
            <h2 >Route Configuration</h2>
            <p>Routes are defined using the Router class and the <em>add</em> method. 
            Here is an example of a simple web server with route configuration.</p>
<pre class="ui code segment">
require ejs.web
let server: HttpServer = new HttpServer
var router = new Router
router.add("/User/{action}", {controller: "User"})
router.addRestful()
router.show()
</pre>
            <p>This example defines a route for URIs that begin with <em>"/User/"</em>.
            The route pattern is an extended regular expression pattern that is used to match against the 
            client request URI. If the route pattern matches the URI, the route is selected to process 
            the request.</p>
            <h3>Route Ordering</h3>
            <p>Routes are processed in the order in which they are defined. Each route is tested in turn and the first
            matching route is used to process the request.  So ordering route definitions is very important. Routes
            with longer or more qualified route criteria should be defined first before more general routes.</p>
            <h2 >Route Processing</h2>
            <p>To process a request, The Ejscript route engine examines each of the configured routes to determine the 
            best matching route for a request.  It does this by considering each route in the order they are defined in
            the configuration file. Each route is tested over a sequence of steps. 
            Not all steps are required. However, the selected route will always perform pattern match, param definition and 
            target execution.  If a route fails to match at a step, the route is discarded and the next configured route 
            is considered.</p>
            <h3>Route Timing</h3>
            <p>Ejscript will initiate request routing at a different time depending on whether the request has form data. 
            If a request has form data, it is worthwhile to delay routing until after the form data
            has been read from the client. This enables the routing directives to take action based on the received form
            data. If a request has no form data, it is routed immediately after the HTTP headers have been read and 
            parsed.</p>
            <p>A request with form data has a <em>Content-Type</em> header of
            <em>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</em>. Requests with a <em>Content-Type</em> set to 
            <em>multipart/form-data</em> which indicates form based file upload, will also delay routing until the uploaded
            file has been fully received.</p>

            <a id="step-pattern"></a>
            <h3>Pattern Matching</h3>
            <p>A route pattern is a specially prepared regular expression that can be quickly matched against the 
            request URI. The route pattern may match the entire request URI, just a subset at the start of the URI
            or any portion in between. Regular expressions are ideal for route patterns as they can express a wide 
            variety of URI formats and can also extract sub-expressions for later evaluation.</p>
            <h4>URI Tokens</h4>
            <p>Often the request URI will not only provide a path to a resource, but it will contain tokens of 
            information that must be isolated and extracted from the URI. Ejscript route patterns provide an easy and
            efficient means to extract such tokens and define them as request params.
            To do this, Ejscript route patterns extend the standard regular expression syntax via embedded tokens.</p>
            
            <p>A token is a 
            portion of the URI that is enclosed in braces "{token}". The token name is a symbolic name that will be used
            later to define a request parameter. In the request URI, any sequence of characters except 
            "/" are acceptable in the token name. For example the route pattern:</p>
<pre class="ui code segment">
router.add("/Dash/({product}))
</pre>
will match the URI:
<pre class="ui code segment">
/Dash/firefox
</pre>
            <p>A token can be made optional by wrapping in <em>()</em>.
            After pattern matching, the request param <em>product</em> will be set to "firefox".</p>
            <p>To enable the extension token syntax, the standard regular expression syntax for repeat sub-expressions 
                that uses braces: {m,n} needs to be back-quoted. i.e. \{m,n}.</p>
            <h4>Conditional Sub-Expressions</h4>
            <p>Conditional sub-expressions can be defined by wrapping in "(" and ")". This means the wrapped
            sub-expression is valid but not required. For example:</p>
<pre class="ui code segment">
router.add("/Dash/({product}(/{configuration})))
</pre>
will match any of the URIs:
<pre class="ui code segment">
/Dash/firefox
/Dash/firefox/debug
/Dash/firefox/release
</pre>
            <h4>Anchoring Route Patterns</h4>
            <p>It is wise to anchor route patterns to the start of the URI. This is done by using the <em>"^"</em> character
            at the start of the URI. If the pattern describes the full request URI, the pattern can anchor to the end
            of the URI by appending <em>"$"</em>. For example:</p>
<pre class="ui code segment">
^/{controller}/{action}$
</pre>

            <a id="step-method"></a>
            <h3>Method Matching</h3>
            <p>Method matching is an optional step. Routes can be configured to only match certain HTTP methods. 
            Method matching tests the supported route methods against the actual request HTTP method. </p>
<pre class="ui code segment">
router.add("/Dash/product/buy", {method: "POST"})
</pre>
            <p>By default a route supports all methods.</p>

            <a id="step-header"></a>
            <h3>Header Matching</h3>
            <p>Header matching is an optional step. Routes can be configured to require that the request has HTTP
            headers with or without defined values. For example: a route may wish to only be relevant for a 
            particular browser:</p>
<pre class="ui code segment">
r.add(function (request) request.header("user-agent").contains("Chrome"))
})
</pre>
            <p>This defines a route with a custom matching function. The function is invoked to test the request. If
            it returns true, the route is selected.</p>

            <a id="step-form"></a>
            <h3>Form Value Matching</h3>
            <p>Form value matching is an optional step. Routes can be configured to require that the request has 
            form data with or without defined values. Form data is sourced from the request URI query string and from
            form body (POST) data. Form data must have a Content-Type of "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" &mdash;
            normal HTML forms are encoded this way.</p>
<pre class="ui code segment">
r.add(function (request) request.params("name").match(/(Mary)|(John)))
</pre>
            <p>This route will match the URIs: </p>
<pre class="ui code segment">
/info/file.html?name=Mary
/info/file.html?name=John
</pre>

            <a id="step-param"></a>
            <h3>Param Definition</h3>
            <p>After a route fully qualifies, request params are created for route pattern tokens. This provides an
            easy mechanism for extracting useful information from the request URI and passing it to the web page or
            controller for processing.</p>
