            <p class="question">How to print to the console?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Use the print global function:</p>
                <pre class="ui code segment">
<b>home&gt;</b> ejs
print("Hello World")
<b>Hello World</b>
</pre>
            </div>
            <p class="question"><a id="fileIO"></a> How to read from a file?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>There are several ways to read from a file. To read the entire file into a string:</p>
                <pre class="ui code segment">
str = File.getString("file.txt")
</pre>
                <p>To read a file line-by-line:</p>
                <pre class="ui code segment">
lines = File.getLines("file.txt")
for each (l in lines) {
    print(l)
}
</pre>
            </div>
            <p class="question"><a id="trace"></a> How can I trouble-shoot with trace?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Run ejscript with the logging switch "--log". The logging switch takes the following parameters:</p>
                <pre class="ui code segment">
ejs --log logName[:logLevel]
</pre>
                <p>Where logLevel is a number between 0 and 9. Zero is the least verbose.</p>
                <p class="question"></p>
                <p>In the default binary distribution or if ejs is built in debug mode, level 2 will trace each source
                code and assembler instruction as it is executed.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="question"><a id="enhancements"></a>Do I need to share my enhancements?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>If you are using the GPL license, you must make your enhancements available to all under the terms
                of the <a href="../licensing/gpl.html">GPL License</a>. If you are using a commercial license, you
                may keep your modifications private. You are however, very welcome to share your enhancements with us
                for inclusion in future releases. </p>
            </div>

            <p class="question"><a id="contributeGpl"></a>Will my patches make it into the Open
            Source version?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The <a href="https://embedthis.com/developers/contributors.html">contributors agreement</a> ensures that if
                your patches are included in the commercial version of Ejscript, they will always be included in the
                open source version. All patches are examined for suitability and sometimes several individuals submit
                similar patches. As such, we cannot guarantee that your code will be included in the product.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="question"><a id="standAlone"></a>I'm using Ejscript as a stand-alone program
            can I use the GPL?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Probably Yes. If you distribute your application and you choose the GPL license, then you must also
                make your source code that is linked with an of the Ejscript programs, available to others. If you do
                not link (using either dynamic or static linking) with Ejscript, you may not need to share your code.
                Read the <a href="../licensing/gpl.html">GPL License</a> for full details. If you want to keep
                your source code private, Embedthis provides commercial licenses for that purpose.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="question"><a id="distributeGpl"></a>Can I distribute my product that
            includes Ejscript under the GPL license?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Yes. You just need to make your source code that links with Ejscript available to all.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="question"><a id="prototypeGpl"></a>Can I prototype using the GPL license?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Yes. You can prototype and develop internally using the GPL license. If you distribute your product,
                you must either provide source code to all, or you will need a commercial license.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="question"><a id="commercialLicense"></a>When do I need to take out a
            commercial license?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>If you want to keep your source code private or if you want support and a commercial warranty, then
                a commercial license is probably necessary.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="question"><a id="linkNonGpl"></a>Can I link in non-GPL code?</p>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>If you are using the GPL license, you can link in code that has a GPL-compatible license. If you are
                using the commercial license, you can link in any non-GPL code.</p>
            </div>
