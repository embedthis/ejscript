<a name="print"></a>
<p class="question">How to print to the console?</p>
<div class="answer">
  <p>Use the print global function:</p>
  <pre class="ui code segment">
<b>home&gt;</b> ejs
print("Hello World")
<b>Hello World</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="question"><a id="fileIO"></a> How to read from a file?</p>
<div class="answer">
  <p>
    There are several ways to read from a file. To read the entire file into a
    string:
  </p>
  <pre class="ui code segment">
str = File.getString("file.txt")
</pre
  >
  <p>To read a file line-by-line:</p>
  <pre class="ui code segment">
lines = File.getLines("file.txt")
for each (l in lines) {
    print(l)
}
</pre
  >
</div>
<p class="question"><a id="trace"></a> How can I trouble-shoot with trace?</p>
<div class="answer">
  <p>
    Run ejscript with the logging switch "--log". The logging switch takes the
    following parameters:
  </p>
  <pre class="ui code segment">
ejs --log logName[:logLevel]
</pre
  >
  <p>Where logLevel is a number between 0 and 9. Zero is the least verbose.</p>
  <p class="question"></p>
  <p>
    In the default binary distribution or if ejs is built in debug mode, level 2
    will trace each source code and assembler instruction as it is executed.

<p class="question">
  <a id="enhancements"></a>Do I need to share my enhancements?
</p>
<div class="answer">
  <p>
    If you are using the GPL license, you must make your enhancements available
    to all under the terms of the
    <a href="../licensing/gpl.html">GPL License</a>. If you are using a
    commercial license, you may keep your modifications private. You are
    however, very welcome to share your enhancements with us for inclusion in
    future releases.
  </p>
</div>

<p class="question">
  <a id="contributeGpl"></a>Will my patches make it into the Open Source
  version?
</p>
<div class="answer">
  <p>
    The
    <a href="https://www.embedthis.com/developers/contributors.html"
      >contributors agreement</a
    >
    ensures that if your patches are included in the commercial version of
    Ejscript, they will always be included in the open source version. All
    patches are examined for suitability and sometimes several individuals
    submit similar patches. As such, we cannot guarantee that your code will be
    included in the product.
  </p>
</div>

<p class="question">
  <a id="standAlone"></a>I'm using Ejscript as a stand-alone program can I use
  the GPL?
</p>
<div class="answer">
  <p>
    Probably Yes. If you distribute your application and you choose the GPL
    license, then you must also make your source code that is linked with an of
    the Ejscript programs, available to others. If you do not link (using either
    dynamic or static linking) with Ejscript, you may not need to share your
    code. Read the <a href="../licensing/gpl.html">GPL License</a> for full
    details. If you want to keep your source code private, Embedthis provides
    commercial licenses for that purpose.
  </p>
</div>

<p class="question">
  <a id="distributeGpl"></a>Can I distribute my product that includes Ejscript
  under the GPL license?
</p>
<div class="answer">
  <p>
    Yes. You just need to make your source code that links with Ejscript
    available to all.
  </p>
</div>

<p class="question">
  <a id="prototypeGpl"></a>Can I prototype using the GPL license?
</p>
<div class="answer">
  <p>
    Yes. You can prototype and develop internally using the GPL license. If you
    distribute your product, you must either provide source code to all, or you
    will need a commercial license.
  </p>
</div>

<p class="question">
  <a id="commercialLicense"></a>When do I need to take out a commercial license?
</p>
<div class="answer">
  <p>
    If you want to keep your source code private or if you want support and a
    commercial warranty, then a commercial license is probably necessary.
  </p>
</div>

<p class="question"><a id="linkNonGpl"></a>Can I link in non-GPL code?</p>
<div class="answer">
  <p>
    If you are using the GPL license, you can link in code that has a
    GPL-compatible license. If you are using the commercial license, you can
    link in any non-GPL code.
  </p>
</div>
