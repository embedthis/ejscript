<h2>Helpful Hints</h2>
<h3>Debug Trace and Logging</h3>
<p>
  Ejscript has a debug logging and trace facility that can help when debugging
  configuration issues or developing your application code that uses Ejscript.
  You can see each script statement as it is executed and what byte codes the VM
  is executing. You can vary the level of logging via the
  <b>--log logfile</b> command line switch for the <b>ejs</b> command. The log
  command line switch has the format
</p>
<pre class="ui code segment">
ejs --log logFile:logLevel
</pre>
<p>
  The log level can be from 0 to 9, with 9 being the most verbose level. If
  compiling your scripts with debug enabled via the --debug switch, a log level
  setting of 5 will trace each source statement and assembly byte code to the
  log file.
