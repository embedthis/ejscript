            <h2>Helpful Hints</h2>
            <h3>Debug Trace and Logging</h3>
            <p>Ejscript has a debug logging and trace facility that can help when debugging configuration issues or
            developing your application code that uses Ejscript. You can see each script statement as it is executed
            and what byte codes the VM is executing. You can vary the level of logging via the <b>--log logfile</b>
            command line switch for the <b>ejs</b> command. The log command line switch has the
            format</p>
                <pre class="ui code segment">
ejs --log logFile:logLevel
</pre>
            <p>The log level can be from 0 to 9, with 9 being the most verbose level. If compiling your scripts with
            debug enabled via the --debug switch, a log level setting of 5 will trace each source statement and
            assembly byte code to the log file.</p>
