<h1>Ejscript Project Resources</h1>
<p>
  Embedthis developers use a variety of tools and resources to better manage the
  Ejscript project. These include source code control and an issue tracking
  database.
</p>

<h2>
  <a href="https://github.com/embedthis/ejscript">Source Code Repository</a>
</h2>
<p>
  The Ejscript source code is hosted in a Git
  <a href="http://github.com/embedthis/ejscript">repository</a>. We provide open
  read-only access. Write access is available to regular contributing
  developers.
</p>

<h2>
  <a href="http://github.com/embedthis/ejscript/issues">Issue and Bug List</a>
</h2>
<p>
  The Ejscript open issue and bug list is stored in a
  <a href="http://github.com/embedthis/ejscript/issues">GitHub Issue</a>
  database. Use the issue list to report bugs, issues and questions. Make sure
  you do the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fully describe any issue &mdash; don't be too brief</li>
  <li>The exact sequence of operations to provoke the issue</li>
  <li>Specify the software version and how you built it</li>
  <li>Describe your system platform: O/S and hardware</li>
  <li>Provide a stand-alone test case that reproduces the issue</li>
  <li>If relevant, upload edited log files and command line trace</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Most folks are way too brief in describing issues. To solve quickly, more
  detail really helps.
