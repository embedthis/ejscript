            <h1>Types and Variable Declarations</h1>
            
            <a id="modes"></a>
            <p>This document describes how types and declarations work in Ejscript. This is largely governed by the
            <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm">ECMAScript</a> standard,
            but depending on the Ejscript <a href="modes.html">Language Compliance Mode</a>, variable declarations,
            scope and visibility may operate slightly differently. The differences are documented below.</p>
            
            <a id="library"></a>
            <h2 >System Type Library</h2>
            <p>Ejscript defines a set of <a href="core.html">core system types</a> to provide a powerful and flexible
            system library. The types provide a large selection of methods to manage and operate on the types. The
            primitive types (booleans, numbers, objects, regular expressions and strings) are instances of these
            types.</p>
            <p>The type system is also extensible. Users can create new types by scripting or by creating native types
            in the C language.</p>
            <p>The Ejscript system library consists of three groups of types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Standard JavaScript types</li>
                <li>Ejscript extension types</li>
                <li>Ejscript Web Framework types</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Standard Types</h3>
            <p>The core types consist of the standard JavaScript types: Array, Boolean, Date, Error, Function, Number,
            Object, RegExp and String.</p>
            <h3>Ejscript Extension Types</h3>
            <p>Ejscript adds a library system types: BinaryStream, ByteArray, Dispatcher, Event, File, Http, Iterator,
            Namespace, Null, Reflect, Socket, TextStream, Type, Url, XMLHttp, and Void. These types add support for
            file and network IO, eventing and listening, byte data access and management and introspection via type
            reflection.</p>
            <p>The Ejscript web framework provides a Model/View/Controller framework and adds these types: Application,
            Controller, Cookie, Database, GoogleConnector, Host, HtmlConnector, Record, Request, Session, UploadFile,
            View and ViewConnector.</p>
            <a id="declarations"></a>
            <h2 >Variable Declarations</h2>
            <p>Variables are declared by the <b>var</b> or <b>let</b> keyword. The var keyword will define a variable
            in the top level of the current scope whereas a <b>let</b> variable declaration will define a variable in
            the current block scope. In other words, var declarations will hoist to the top-most block in a
            function/class or global script, whereas a let variable will be scoped to the block in which it is
            declared.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
function test() {
    x = 0           // Assign zero to the "x" created by the var declaration below
    {               // Create an inner block
        let x = 2   // This creates a new, local "x"
        print(x)    // Prints the local "x"
    }               // The inner <b>"let x"</b> disappears from here
    var x           // Define "x", exists from start of function
    print(x)        // Print the outer "x"
}
test()
<b>
2
0
</b></pre>
            <p>The <b>var</b> declaration above defines a variable "x" that exists from the start of the function. 
            This is because <b>var</b> declarations hoist to the top of the function. Whereas, the <b>let</b> 
            declaration of <b> x</b> is local to the block and creates a new "x" that only exists inside the block.
            <h3 >Variable Scope</h3>
            <p>Variables can be defined in several locations. Depending on the location, the variable declarations
            behave differently. The locations are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Global</li>
                <li>Class Static</li>
                <li>Class Instance</li>
                <li>Function Local</li>
                <li>Block Local</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All variables declared by using <b>let</b> will be block local and are scoped to the block enclosing its
            declaration.</p>
            <h3>Global Variables</h3>
            <p>Variables declared with var and outside classes, interfaces and functions are global variables. 
            In Ejscript, global variables are by default
            limited in their visibility to the source file in which they are declared. If the variable is defined with
            a <b>public</b> qualifier, the variable will be visible to code defined in other source files.</p>
            <h3>Class Static Variables</h3>
            <p>Variables declared inside classes and
            decorated with the <b>static</b> keyword will be class variables and will be shared among all instances of
            the class. The visibility of class variables can be modified by using <a href="#visibility">visibility
            qualifiers</a>.</p>
            <h3>Class Instance Variables</h3>
            <p>Variables declared inside classes and not decorated with the <b>static</b> keyword will be class
            instance variables. Each object instance of the class will have its own copy of the variable. The
            visibility of instance variables can be modified by using <a href="#visibility">visibility
            qualifiers</a>.</p>
            <h3>Function Local Variables</h3>
            <p>Variables declared using <b>var</b> inside functions, are local variables. They will be re-created each
            time the function is executed and are declared at the top-most block of the function.</p>
            <h3>Block Variables</h3>
            <p>Variables declared with <b>let</b> are local to the block enclosing the declaration.</p>
            
            <a id="visibility"></a>
            <h2 >Controlling Variable Visibility</h2>
            <p>Standard JavaScript provides little control over variable visibility and this is a problem as programs
            grow, or as source code from multiple sources is integrated or combined. Ejscript addresses these issues in
            two ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Visibility qualifiers</li>
                <li>Module directives</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Visibility Qualifiers</h3>
            <p>Classes, global variables and function declarations can optionally be qualified as either:
            <b>internal</b> or <b>public</b>.</p>
            <p>An <b>internal</b> qualifier, which is the default, defines a variable or function to be visible only
            within the defining source file. A <b>public</b> qualifier enables the variable or function to be visible
            to code in other source files.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
public var message = "Hello"
public function greeting() {
    print(message)
}
internal function privateGreeting() {
    print(message + " Friends")
}
public class Friends() { }
</pre>
            <p>Variables or functions inside a class can also be qualified with <b>private</b> which makes the
            declaration private to the class and invisible to outsiders. Similarly, <b>protected</b> will make the
            declaration visible inside the class and to any sub-classes.</p>
            <h3>Modules</h3>
            <p>Ejscript provides a powerful <b>module</b> facility to control the visibility of a set of classes,
            variables or functions.</p>
            <p>The <b>module</b> directive groups and qualifies a set of declarations so that they will not conflict or
            collide with other names.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
module acme.rockets {
    var version = "1.0"
    function BlastOff() {
    } 
}
</pre>
            <p>This creates a module named "acme.rockets" and prefixes declarations with the module name.</p>
            <p>It is important that you choose a unique module name that won't clash with other modules. A reverse
            domain name is one safe option. For example: "com.embedthis.appweb".</p>
            <p>To use a access a module, users need to add a <b>require</b> directive to their code.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
require acme.rockets
BlastOff()
</pre>
            <p>The <b>require</b> directive adds the "acme.rockets" module to the set of open modules and makes
            visible the declarations defined in the module.</p>
            <p>When creating modules, multiple source files can contribute code into the same module. The Ejscript
            compiler will aggregate the code and combine it into a single module.</p>
            
            <a id="undeclared"></a>
            <h2 >Undeclared Variables</h2>
            <p>It is is not essential to declare variables before using them. If you assign a value to an undeclared
            variable, the Ejscript virtual machine will dynamically create the variable when it is first assigned. In
            standard JavaScript, assigning to an such an undeclared variable will create a new global variable. In
            other words, forgetting to declare a variable, even when done in function code, will transparently create
            an unintended global declaration.</p>
            <p>Ejscript mode treats assignments to undeclared variables differently by creating local
            variables instead of global variables. This is much safer and more secure. If you really need to create a
            global variable, you can use the <b>global</b> object.</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
global.name = 7
</pre>
            <p>This will create a new global variable called <b>globalVar</b> not matter where and what scope this code
            is executed in.</p>
            
            <a id="typeAnnotations"></a>
            <h2 >Optional Type Annotations</h2>
            <p>In JavaScript, variables are not explicitly typed. The type of a variable is defined by the value of the
            data assigned to the variable. Consequently, variables can change their type at run-time. One minute, they
            can contain an integer, and the next, a string. This is not necessarily bad. In fact, it can be very useful.
            However, there are times when you want to control the type and prevent such type changes.</p>
            <p>Ejscript optionally allows variables to be defined with an type annotation. You can choose to either
            specify the type of the variable by appending ": TypeName" or leave the declaration untyped &mdash; it is
            your choice. Adding type declarations makes your intent explicit as to the range of values a variable can
            take. The compiler and the virtual machine can then enforce that choice and automatically convert values or
            trap errors if an incompatible value is assigned to the variable. For example:</p>
            <pre class="ui code segment">
x = "Hello World"  // Auto create a variable "x"
var y = 7          // Declare "y", but leave it untyped then assign 7 
var z: Number      // Type annotated. Declare "z" and type as a Number 
y = x              // "y" now becomes a string. This is Ok.
z = "Not allowed"  // The will be prevented this because "z" is typed as a Number 
</pre>
            <p>When this script is compiled, the compiler will define two variables "y" and "z". The "z"
            variable declaration will be typed to only hold numeric values. When the script is later run, Ejscript will
            define the variable x and set its value to "Hello World". It will then assign the number 7 to "y" and
            then will copy the string in "x" into "y" effectively changing its type. Lastly, an attempt to
            assign "Not allowed" into the variable "z" will be caught and will throw an exception.</p>
            <p>Judicious use of type annotations can increase the performance of the generated byte code. When the
            compiler knows the type, it can often bind to the actual properties and methods on that variable. Optional
            type annotation is also very useful for API interfaces and when generating documentation.</p>
            <p>The Ejscript documentation generation tool (ejsmod) uses type annotations when documenting APIs. But
            remember, no-one is forcing you to use type annotation. Use it if it helps your code. You can also add type
            annotations incrementally as you develop and your design solidifies.</p>
