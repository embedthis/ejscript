            <h1>Language Syntax</h1>
            <p>This is a quick summary of the Ejscript syntax. For a more detailed specification, see the official
            <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm">ECMAScript-262</a> Language
            Specification document.</p><a id="tokens"></a>
            <h2 >Language Tokens</h2>
            <p>Ejscript is case sensitive and uses UTF-8 as its input character stream. White space between tokens is
            ignored with the exception that statements that omit trailing semicolons must be on a line by
            themselves.</p><a id="comments"></a>
            <h3>Comments</h3>
            <p>Comments can use either the C commenting style with text between /* */ delimiters, or the C++ style may
            be used where text from // to the end of the line is regarded as a comment.</p><a id="identifiers"></a>
            <h3>Identifiers</h3>
            <p>Identifiers are names used for variables and functions. Identifiers must begin with either a letter, an
            underscore '_', dollar sign '$' or an '@'. Identifiers must not be a reserved word from the table
            below:</p><a id="reserved"></a>
            <h3>Reserved Words</h3>
            <p>Ejscript regards all these words as reserved:</p>
            <blockquote class="ui code segment">
                <p>abstract, as, break, case, call, callee, cast, catch, class, const, continue, debugger, default,
                delete, do, dynamic, each, else, enum, enumerable, extends, false, final, finally, for, function,
                generator, get, goto, has, if, implements, in, include, instanceof, interface, internal, intrinsic, is,
                like, let, module, namespace, native, new, null, override, private, protected, prototype, public,
                readonly, return, set, standard, static, strict, super, synchronized, switch, this, throw, to, true,
                try, typeof, var, undefined, use, void, volatile, while, with, and yield.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>It is also recommended that you do not use any of the following words as ECMA standards may implement
            them in future:</p>
            <blockquote class="ui code segment">
                <p>abstract, boolean, byte, char, double, export, float, long, package, short and transient.</p>
            </blockquote><a id="declarations"></a> <a id="references"></a>
