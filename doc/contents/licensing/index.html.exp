</p>

<h2>Open Source License</h2>
<p>
  Ejscript my be used with the <a href="gpl.html">GPL Open Source license</a>.
  This is ideal for evaluating Ejscript, for internal use, stand-alone use, or
  for integrating exclusively with other GPL software. If you intend to
  distribute your software and link Ejscript with your application, the GPL
  requires you to provide public and full access to all source code and
  documentation on a nondiscriminatory basis. If you do not wish to provide
  source code to your application, you must purchase a commercial license.
</p>

<h3>Evaluating Ejscript</h3>
<p>
  If you are evaluating Ejscript internally, and not distributing any products
  containing Ejscript, then you may be able to use the GPL license for this
  evaluation. Once complete, you may purchase a commercial license so that you
  can distribute your product. You may evaluate, develop, modify, and embed
  Ejscript in your application or product provided it is not distributed. You
  may copy and modify the source code provided all copies fall under the GPL
  license.
</p>

<h3>Stand Alone Use</h3>
<p>
  If you are using Ejscript in a stand-alone manner as free-standing binaries,
  and are not integrating the Ejscript source code or libraries with your
  software to create a derivative work, then the GPL license may be sufficient.
  Stand-alone use does not permit linking Ejscript using either static or
  dynamic linking.
</p>

<h3>Use with Other GPL Software</h3>
<p>
  If you are integrating Ejscript source or libraries into your application and
  your software is also fully licensed under the GPL license, you may use
  Ejscript with the GPL license and embed Ejscript in your applications or
  devices. You do not need any other agreement or license &mdash; the GPL is all
  you require.
</p>

<h3>Embedding with Non-GPL Software</h3>
<p>
  If Ejscript is embedded into your application, or your application is linked
  using static or dynamic linking with libraries containing any Ejscript source
  code and you do not wish to publish your source code under the GPL, then you
  will need the Ejscript Commercial license.
